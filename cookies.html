                    <h3>Cookie Policy</h3>
                    <p>Last updated: 15 November 2021</p>

                    <p>This page regards premiumcasinos.co.uk cookie policy exclusively. </p>

                    <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
                    <p>This website uses – like most other sites – cookies. Cookies are small text files that will be stored on your computer, phone, tablet or comparable unit with the purpose of recognizing the device, remembering preferences, creating statistics and targeting adverts. Cookies can contain text, numbers or dates but no personal data is stored in a cookie, and they cannot contain malicious code (e.g. a virus). We and the following data processors have access to the data </p>
                    <p>stored: </p>
                    <p>Microsoft Ltd., </p>
                    <p>Cloudflare, Inc.,</p>
                    <p>Google Ltd., </p>
                    <p>Facebook Ltd.</p>
                    <p>When you use our website you accept the use of cookies, including third-party cookies, but it is at any given time possible to delete or block cookies. At the bottom of this page, you can see which cookies are stored on your computer, mobile phone, tablet or another device when you use our website.</p>
                    <p>If you delete or block cookies adverts will become less relevant for you and appear more often. You may also experience that the website does not function perfectly and there may be content you do not have access to.</p>
                    <p>Cookies are also stored in log files that are collected from the site’s users. Log files are generated from all websites and this site is no exception. Basically, log files contain an overview over 1) which pages have been visited on the site, 2) when they have been visited, and 3) where they have been accessed from, which means the log files collect the user’s IP address. Based on the collected log file data we are only able to see what city you access the site from and not your exact geographic location. You can read more about how we process your personal data, including your IP address in our <a href="./privacy.html">privacy policy</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Said log files will be used both for monitoring traffic on the site and as a security measure. One of the reasons why we collect IP-addresses is that we can use them to prevent hacker attacks.</p>

                    <p>If we in the log files can see an unusual pattern in where the traffic is coming from it can be a sign of an attempted hacker attack. By monitoring the users’ location via IP addresses we are better equipped to prevent hacker attacks.</p>

                    <p>Log files, including IP addresses, are stored for 5 years before they are deleted.</p>

                    <h4>What do we use cookies for?</h4>
                    <p>We use cookies for an array of purposes, such as optimizing our marketing efforts and your user experience and also securing and improving our website technical functionality.</p>

                    <p>Some of the data we collect through cookies is used to analyse our users’ behaviour on the site. The cookies can give us an overview of what type of devices the site is accessed via, what pages the users visit, what marketing channels the users come from, and how long time they spend on the site. If users click on ads or affiliate links on the site it will also be registered and included in our analyses of the site.</p>

                    <p>We use the data to optimize our own marketing efforts and as a tool to improve user experience and optimize our website plus to target online ads, so you will be presented with ads that are more relevant for you.</p>

                    <p>Cookies are also used to make the website more functional for its users. The use of cookies means that the users do not have to download as much data when revisiting the site and that the site can remember the users’ preferences. That optimizes the user experience, the loading of content and the site’s response time.</p>
                    <p>The use of cookies makes it possible to make ongoing adaptations on the site to match the user needs to be identified through their behaviour.</p>

                    <p>Besides us, certain third parties also leave cookies on your hard drive when using the site. You can read more about which third parties are under “Third-party plugins that leave cookies”.</p>

                    <h4>What cookies do we use?</h4>

                    <p>You can see a list of the cookies that are stored on your hard drive, mobile or tablet when you use our site, at the bottom of this page. In the following, we will elaborate on the use of different types of cookies.</p>
                    <h4>Heat maps</h4>

                    <p>Periodically the website uses heat maps, which show the users whereabouts on the site. This data and information about this will be stored.</p>

                    <p>Specifically, the heat map is a tool to identify how the specific movement of the users on the website happens and can be useful to know in the process of optimizing our website and its layout.</p>

                    <h4>Cookies used for analysis</h4>

                    <p>The site uses ”Google Analytics” to analyse from which geographical locations the users access the site. That can be identified via the users’ IP addresses.</p>

                    <p>The geographical location means – as mentioned earlier – that we are unable to see the users’ addresses or exact locations, however, the level of detail is that we can see from which city the user accesses the site.</p>

                    <p>The reason why we obtain information on the user’s geographical location is first and foremost to make sure that we only permit access to user’s that are not restricted due to local legislation on gambling.</p>
                    
                    <p>The site also collects anonymous statistics of the user’s visits on the site, including the number of visits, the average time spent on the site and which pages have been loaded. The aim is to segment the site’s users based on factors such as demographics and geography, which makes it possible to structure and understand the target audience with a view to present online ads to them.</p>

                    <h4>Targeted advertising</h4>

                    <p>When you use this site cookies are stored on your hard drive, mobile or tablet that ensures that online ads can be targeted to be especially relevant for you, when you use social media like Facebook and Instagram, and when you visit other websites. It may also mean you are presented with banner ads from us when you browse on other websites.</p>

                    <p>The targeted marketing efforts end no later than 180 days from the time you last visited the site. You can also avoid targeted ads by deleting or blocking cookies.</p>

                    <h4>Third-party plugins that leave cookies</h4>
                    <p>On the website, you may encounter various external plugins, such as embedded Youtube videos or similar features. These plugins may leave a cookie on your hard drive, mobile phone or tablet. This category of cookies stems from third party services on the site.</p>

                    <p>Common third-party cookies include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Youtube – May figure on the site due to embedded videos on the site.</li>
                        <li>Affiliate link cookies – May figure on the site due to us linking to the gaming providers (casinos, poker sites, bingo sites and betting sites).</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The reason why we have included these features on the site is that it may allow us to offer our users more features (such as videos) and other advantages.</p>

                    <h4>How long do we store user information?</h4>
                    <p>Information about the users’ visits to the site is stored for up to 26 months in Google Analytics. If a user visits the site again during the 26 months the storage period will restart and be stored for 26 months from that moment. That is also known as ‘data retention’.</p>

                    <p>Data collection is in accordance with Google’s guidelines and does not contain any personal information of the users.</p>

                    <p>The aim of the ongoing collection of data and storage of data in up to 26 months is to give our users the best possible experience on our site.</p>

                    <p>Google Analytics data is stored for up to 26 months to be able to create statistics of the site’s annual development and to have comparable data going back, and to measure the site’s traffic.</p>

                    <p>Users that have interacted with or visited the site via Facebook Marketing will be stored in a Facebook Pixel for up to 180 days, in accordance with Facebook’s guidelines. All data is anonymised by Facebook.</p>

                    <p>The aim of the Facebook Pixel is to target ads and marketing from the site via Facebook and to present the users with ads matching their interests and needs.</p>
